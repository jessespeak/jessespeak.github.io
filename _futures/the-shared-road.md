**2100 CE**

Lea had been walking for months. The roads unfolded before her like quiet invitations, and she followed without hesitation, trusting her steps to lead her somewhere worth being. Every place she passed through had its own rhythm—a bakery where the air shimmered with the scent of fresh bread, a field dotted with workers laughing as they gathered crops, a quiet village where the only sound was the wind in the trees. She moved through it all, pausing just long enough to help where help was needed, to listen where there were stories, to rest where there was warmth.

Her bag was light, its contents pared down to essentials: a few changes of clothes, a journal with half its pages still blank, and small things she couldn’t bear to part with. The rest of what she needed always seemed to arrive when she needed it. A bed. A meal. A task that filled her hands and heart.

The road she walked that morning was lined with orchards. The trees, heavy with ripe fruit, leaned toward her, their branches sagging under the weight of plums and apples. She passed a group of pickers, their laughter carrying on the breeze. One of them waved to her—a tall man with a sun-creased face and an easy grin.

“Good picking today,” he called.

“It looks like it,” Lea replied, smiling back.

He jogged a few steps toward her, holding out a pair of gloves, the kind that made work easier on tender palms. She shook her head gently and pulled a spare pair of socks from her bag instead, holding them out with a grin.

“Trade?” she asked.

He laughed and took the socks, tucking them into his belt. “Fair deal. Safe travels.”

“And good picking,” she echoed, slipping the gloves into her bag before walking on.

By afternoon, she reached a village clustered along the edge of a river. The air was alive with sound—music, voices, the crackle of food cooking over open flames. The festival had sprung up naturally, its energy fed by the arrival of so many pickers from the surrounding orchards. What began as an evening’s respite had swelled into something more: a celebration of the season, the harvest, the simple joy of being together.

Lea drifted through the square, past tables piled high with food, stalls offering hand-carved trinkets, and groups of people gathered in animated conversation. She caught snippets of laughter, the faint strains of a stringed instrument, the warm hum of contentment that filled the space like a shared secret.

A man at one of the tables waved her over, gesturing to a bowl of stew. “You look like you’ve been walking all day,” he said, his tone rich with mock seriousness. “This will fix that.”

“Wouldn’t say no,” Lea replied, sinking onto the bench with a smile. The stew was thick and hearty, the kind that spoke of long hours and many hands. They shared easy conversation, trading stories of the road and the orchard, the kind of tales that didn’t need a point to be worth telling. When she thanked him, it wasn’t for the stew itself but for the ritual of it—for the act of offering, of sharing, of being seen.

The square became livelier as the sun dipped below the horizon. Musicians gathered on a raised platform at one end, their instruments tuning to a shared rhythm. When they began to play, the crowd surged into motion, their movements as varied as the people themselves. Lea found herself pulled into the dance, her body moving before her mind could catch up.

Around her, laughter rose like sparks, bright and fleeting. She twirled with strangers whose names she didn’t know, whose stories she would never learn, but it didn’t matter. The dance was connection enough.

When the music slowed, she stepped away, breathless and glowing. A woman nearby offered her a drink with a grin. “You looked like you were enjoying that,” she said.

Lea took the drink with a mock-serious nod. “It’s tradition to overdo it at least once.”

“Then you’re doing it right,” the woman replied, laughing.

As the night deepened, Lea wandered to the quieter edges of the festival, her legs pleasantly heavy from dancing. She found a spot by the river where lanterns cast soft reflections on the water, and the sounds of the celebration became a distant hum. A boy was skipping stones nearby, his focus absolute. She watched him for a moment before sitting down to untie her boots, letting the cool grass press against her feet.

When she returned to the square, someone gestured her toward a room above a café—a place to sleep, already prepared. She didn’t ask how they knew she would need it. Such things didn’t need asking. She simply nodded her thanks, her smile warm, and climbed the narrow stairs to the room.

The bed was small but soft, the window open to the night air. Lea lay there for a long time, listening to the muffled sounds of the celebration continuing below. Tomorrow, she would join them in gathering produce. Perhaps the following day too. There were always more roads to walk, more hands to meet, more meals to share. The thought filled her with a quiet joy, like the last note of a song still hanging in the air.

## Analysis

In this imagined future, artificial intelligence exists not as a visible force but as a pervasive, unobtrusive presence that quietly enables a world of trust, simplicity, and profound human connection. Its absence from explicit mention in the scenario is intentional, not to diminish its role but to emphasise its subtle power. In this world, AI isn’t something people interact with often; it’s simply the way things work, enabling a kind of societal harmony that feels, paradoxically, both futuristic and ancient.

Take the baker in the story. He welcomes Lea into his bakery without hesitation, already knowing she will help and contribute meaningfully. His trust is instinctive, and while the story doesn’t delve into why, it’s reasonable to infer that his AI hasn’t flagged any reason for concern. This is trust mediated by technology, but not in a way that requires explicit verification or even awareness. The result is an effortless hospitality that feels deeply human—an enjoyable tradition rather than a practical necessity. In this world, people can lean into moments of generosity, surprise, and delight because they know their own needs will be met as they arise.

This subtle but pervasive mediation allows for spontaneity and connection that is rare in today’s world, where distrust and caution are the unwitting baseline of new social interactions. The baker doesn’t need to ask questions about who Lea is or why she’s passing through. The infrastructure of AI ensures he doesn’t have to, enabling him to simply enjoy the act of welcoming her. This highlights how technology, when truly seamless, might facilitate a return to fundamental human values.

The simplicity of life in this world is striking. Lea trades her time and energy for food, shelter, and moments of connection, echoing older, pre-industrial ways of living. Yet this simplicity is supported by an underlying technological complexity that has removed the burdens of uncertainty and scarcity. Lea doesn’t need to worry about where her next meal or bed will come from, nor does she need to carry currency or negotiate transactions. This freedom allows her to focus entirely on the present—kneading dough, dancing at a festival, or walking to her next destination.

What’s remarkable is how this removes the need for distraction. In our current world, many people fill their time with endless scrolling, news updates, and entertainment, often as an escape from anxiety or unfulfilled expectations. But in Lea’s world, the rhythms of lived experience—work, conversation, shared meals—seem to offer enough richness to keep these distractions at bay. Without the pressure to achieve or own, life becomes lighter, yet paradoxically fuller.

The story raises quiet but profound questions about ownership. The orchards Lea passes seem to exist more as shared resources than as property in the traditional sense. It’s unclear who, if anyone, owns them. Perhaps ownership has become obsolete, with AI balancing supply and demand so effectively that the idea of “having” no longer holds the meaning it once did. The fruit is picked, shared, and enjoyed without the need for markets or profits, creating a commons-like system that works because the network ensures everyone’s needs are met.

This vision stands in stark contrast to our world, where ownership and accumulation often drive inequality and conflict. Here, the need to possess seems to have faded, replaced by a collective understanding that resources are abundant and accessible. It’s a fundamentally different economic model, one that substitutes care and balance for competition.

Physical work, such as Lea’s brief stint in the bakery or the pickers harvesting fruit, remains central to this world. But it doesn’t carry the weight of obligation or survival. Instead, it’s a form of contribution, a way of participating in the flow of life. Lea’s work is temporary and varied, giving her a sense of purpose without tying her down. This kind of work doesn’t demand burnout or sacrifice; it simply fits into the rhythms of a life well-lived, and meaning is immediate and tangible.

Perhaps the most striking implication of this world is how it redefines the individual’s role in society. Lea’s journey, and the ease with which she moves through it, implies a superhuman interconnectedness. Each person is like an ant in a colony, their movements and needs subtly in service of—and supported by—the whole. This isn’t a loss of individuality but a shift in focus. The network takes care of the logistics: shelter, food, and tools, so people can *simply live*.

The most intriguing aspect of this imagined future is how unremarkable it feels. The world hasn’t been transformed into a utopia of shiny technology and grand visions. Instead, it feels grounded, earthy, and deeply familiar. The AI isn’t a tool people use; it’s an environment they inhabit, one that amplifies the best of human nature—trust, connection, and joy—while removing many of the frictions that make modern life so fraught. Perhaps the future isn’t about doing more or being more but about making space for the things that have always mattered most.

## Thinking points

* In a world without significant friction or struggle, would personal growth and creativity flourish in new ways or fade in the absence of challenges?
* If AI quietly steers people toward societal equality and harmony, what happens when individual desires (e.g. for influence or recognition) conflict with the system’s subtle nudges?
* In a life defined by impermanence and fluid connections, how do people anchor their identity and legacy—or does the need for them simply fade away?
