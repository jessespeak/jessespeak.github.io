Emma stood in her kitchen, hands on her hips, surveying the job ahead. Her old cabinets were warped and leaning. The floor tiles had seen better days, and the sink had a slow but insistent leak. It was pretty daunting.

“Luma,” she said, glancing at the small device glowing softly on her counter, “I’m not sure I can do this.”

“You can,” Luma said in a calm, encouraging tone. “Let’s take it one step at a time. First, let’s clear the old kitchen. The pry bar is in the delivery box outside.”

Emma opened her door and found a neatly packed box waiting, delivered just an hour earlier. It contained all the tools she’d need for the day: a pry bar, gloves, safety goggles, and a dust sheet. The supplier, HomeWorks Direct, had everything ready for her project, from materials to tools, arriving just when she needed them.

Emma suited up, gripping the pry bar awkwardly at first. She stared at the first cabinet, hesitating. “What if I mess this up?” she asked.

“You won’t. This is the fun part,” Luma replied. “Start at the edge. Slide the bar underneath and apply steady pressure.”

Emma followed the instructions. The cabinet creaked, then cracked free from the wall. She almost laughed at how easy it was. She moved on to the next, Luma gently validating her actions and celebrating her progress. By the end of the morning, her kitchen was stripped bare. It was exhausting but satisfying work, and with every cabinet she removed, her confidence grew.

By lunchtime, Emma wiped the sweat from her brow and sat on a stool in the now-empty space. Luma chimed in, “Your materials for today’s work have arrived. I’ve updated the plan based on your pace. Ready to unpack?”

The next delivery had everything: sheets of plywood, bundles of tiles, a tile cutter, and even a lightweight saw of a type she’d never seen before. These items were unfamiliar to Emma, but Luma guided her through unpacking and organising them.

“Next up,” Luma said, “the floor tiles. Let’s start with a dry layout.”

Emma knelt on the concrete subfloor, following Luma’s instructions. The tiles snapped together with satisfying clicks, and as she worked, she realised how much she was learning. By the time she started securing them with adhesive, her earlier hesitation had vanished.

That was until the pipe burst.

It happened without warning. Emma had just placed the last tile when a hissing sound filled the room, followed by the unmistakable splash of water. She froze, her heart racing. “Luma!” she yelled.

“I see it,” Luma said, calm as ever. “Turn off the main water valve. It’s outside, to the left of your front door.”

Emma dashed out and twisted the valve shut, breathing hard as the water slowed and finally stopped. She returned and Luma swiftly analysed the situation.

“The pipe under the sink has probably split. Lean forward so I can get a better view. Can you feel the split with your fingers?” Luma asked. Emma’s fingers probed gently around the pipe and she nodded. “I’ve ordered a replacement part and added a pipe wrench to your next delivery. It will arrive in a few hours.”

Emma sat on the floor, her nerves still frayed. “Plumbing’s always felt scary to me. Not sure I’m up to it.”

“You are,” Luma reassured her. “I’ll guide you. And if you need help, I can see if there are any volunteers in our community who can assist.”

“Nope,” Emma said, straightening. “I want to give it a go. I want to do the whole job myself.”

The part arrived as expected, along with a suitable wrench. Luma’s instructions were clear and precise - a bit of plumbing theory, some dos and don’ts, and detailed step-by-step coaching. Emma removed the broken section, carefully threading the new pipe into place. It took her a few tries, but soon the job was done.

“Looks good to me. Now, turn the water back on and check for leaks,” Luma prompted.

Emma hesitated, then went outside to open the valve. Back in the kitchen, she crouched under the sink, watching intently. The water flowed smoothly, without a single drop escaping. She exhaled in relief.

“Job well done,” Luma said. “Crisis averted.”

Emma laughed, shaking her head. “I’m more relieved than I’d like to admit!”

“And you’ve learned a new skill,” Luma added. “Ready to get back to the cabinets?”

The rest of the project went more smoothly. The cabinets clicked into place, the countertop was cut to fit perfectly, and by the end of the week, the kitchen looked like something out of a magazine.

When Emma placed the last screw, she stepped back and admired her work. “It’s beautiful,” she said.

“I’ve submitted the final inspection to the regulatory AI,” Luma said. “All standards met. Done and dusted!”

As she cleaned up, Emma felt a deep sense of pride. The kitchen wasn’t just new—it was hers. She’d faced challenges, learned skills she never thought she could, and built something with her own hands. It was actually very doable with Luma’s guiding help. Luma’s soft glow on the counter seemed to mirror her satisfaction.

“What’s next then?” Luma asked.

Emma smiled, stretching her arms. “Maybe the bathroom,” she said. “But that’s going to have to wait. I need a break!”

## Analysis

The story of Emma and her AI assistant, Luma, shows a future where AI supports people in tasks once considered the domain of skilled trades. Knowledge and precision, traditionally gained through years of practice, become accessible to anyone willing to try. Emma’s experience—from feeling unsure to completing her kitchen—illustrates how AI can help people approach technical challenges with confidence.

Many people find home improvement projects intimidating. Jobs like fixing plumbing or replacing cabinets require the right tools and the know-how to use them. For Emma, the idea of starting such a project felt overwhelming. Luma provided clear and calm guidance, helping her break the process into manageable steps. From choosing tools to solving unexpected problems like a burst pipe, Emma gradually gained the skills to tackle each task. Learning by doing, at her own pace, she not only completed the work but also grew more confident with every step.

AI today is widely applied to desk-based professions like data analysis, customer service, and content creation. Discussions about its impact often centre on automation and the risk of job displacement in these fields. However, this focus on knowledge work overlooks how AI could change industries that rely on physical skill. Trades such as plumbing, building, and electrical work are often seen as relatively disruption-proof because they require hands-on expertise and decisions made in context. Emma’s story suggests an alternative. Rather than expecting the advent of humanoid robots to replace tradespeople, personal AI assistants simply enable individuals to take on these tasks themselves, using tailored advice and practical support.

This shift could bring significant changes. Many tradespeople depend on routine jobs—repairing leaks, fitting appliances, or tiling floors—for steady income. With AI helping people to complete these tasks themselves, the availability of such work might decline. Tradespeople could focus on more complex or specialist tasks where AI is less effective. Alternatively, some might shift to roles as consultants, offering guidance remotely through AI platforms. In these roles, tradespeople could share their expertise while leaving the physical work to their clients.

The market for tools and materials could also adapt. In Emma’s case, Luma ensured everything she needed arrived just in time, supplied by a single provider. This approach eliminates the need to buy and store equipment that might only be used once. People could rent professional-grade tools for specific tasks, making projects more affordable and reducing waste. AI could help manage supply and demand across communities, ensuring resources are available exactly when needed. This flexibility could suit different working styles, from those who prefer to take their time with home improvements to those inspired to complete a project in one intense burst.

Regulation is another area likely to change. Today, building work often involves lengthy approval processes and inspections. Emma’s story shows how regulatory AI might streamline these steps. By accessing real-time data through devices like smart glasses, AI could inspect and approve work remotely. This would make compliance faster and easier, removing much of the red tape that currently complicates large DIY projects.

As knowledge work becomes increasingly automated, some people might turn to trades as an alternative career. An influx of workers could lead to an oversupply of labour, arriving just as demand for basic trade work starts to decline. These shifts in supply and demand could create challenges for individuals and industries alike. However, the benefits of AI-enabled DIY extend beyond economics. For many, the chance to learn new skills and complete a project themselves provides and a sense of achievement many are hungry for. Emma’s pride in her finished kitchen reflects this emotional reward, which is as valuable as the practical outcome.

In a world where technology often feels distant and abstract, engaging with tangible, hands-on work could provide balance. AI helps make this possible by lowering the barriers that stop many people from attempting novel challenges. Emma’s experience highlights how people can achieve remarkable things with expert, patient support and guidance.

## Thinking points

* Obviously some types of work can be dangerous if approached without care or adequate safety consideraton. Accidents happen. A non-physical AI cannot intervene directly, so there would have to be safeguards and clarity around responsibility.
* If everyone starts feeling more confident and starts undertaking significant DIY projects by themselves, perhaps this will simply raise the bar and tradespeople will find themselves equally busy but focussing on key points or more ambitious projects.
* Not everyone is a starter/finisher, so this might lead to a lot of half-finished projects. Is that a problem though? If a kitchen refit spreads out over the course of a year but the owner is fine working in an unhurried way, that’s surely fine. AI can insist on getting the essentials in place: safety, security and reliability.
